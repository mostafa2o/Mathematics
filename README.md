# Vector Analysis Toolkit
This project is a toolkit for analyzing vectors of all types, including scalar operations, vector addition, dot product, cross product, and more. Itâ€™s built in Python to assist students and researchers in performing vector-related calculations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mostafa2o/vector-analysis-toolkit.git
## How to Use
After installation, you can use the toolkit to perform various vector operations. Below are examples of how to use it:

1. Vector Addition
To add two vectors:
from vector_ops import add_vectors

# Define two vectors as lists
v1 = [1, 2, 3]
v2 = [4, 5, 6]
result = add_vectors(v1, v2)
print(f"Sum of vectors: {result}")
# Output: Sum of vectors: [5, 7, 9]
2. Dot Product
To calculate the dot product of two vectors:
from vector_ops import dot_product

v1 = [1, 2, 3]
v2 = [4, 5, 6]
result = dot_product(v1, v2)
print(f"Dot product: {result}")
# Output: Dot product: 32  (1*4 + 2*5 + 3*6)
3. Cross Product (3D Vectors)
To compute the cross product of two 3D vectors:
from vector_ops import cross_product

v1 = [1, 0, 0]
v2 = [0, 1, 0]
result = cross_product(v1, v2)
print(f"Cross product: {result}")
# Output: Cross product: [0, 0, 1]
4. Scalar Multiplication
To multiply a vector by a scalar:
from vector_ops import scalar_multiply

v = [1, 2, 3]
scalar = 2
result = scalar_multiply(v, scalar)
print(f"Scalar multiplication: {result}")
# Output: Scalar multiplication: [2, 4, 6]
