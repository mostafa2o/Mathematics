# Vector Analysis Toolkit
This project is a Python toolkit for analyzing vectors of all types. It includes operations like addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, dot product, cross product, and magnitude calculation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/vector-analysis-toolkit.git
## How to Use
After installation, you can use the toolkit to perform vector operations. Below are examples:

1. Vector Addition
from vector_ops import add_vectors

v1 = [1, 2, 3]
v2 = [4, 5, 6]
result = add_vectors(v1, v2)
print(f"Sum: {result}")
# Output: Sum: [5, 7, 9]
2. Vector Subtraction
from vector_ops import subtract_vectors

v1 = [1, 2, 3]
v2 = [4, 5, 6]
result = subtract_vectors(v1, v2)
print(f"Difference: {result}")
# Output: Difference: [-3, -3, -3]
3. Scalar Multiplication
from vector_ops import scalar_multiply

v = [1, 2, 3]
scalar = 2
result = scalar_multiply(v, scalar)
print(f"Result: {result}")
# Output: Result: [2, 4, 6]
4. Dot Product
from vector_ops import dot_product

v1 = [1, 2, 3]
v2 = [4, 5, 6]
result = dot_product(v1, v2)
print(f"Dot Product: {result}")
# Output: Dot Product: 32
5. Cross Product (3D Vectors)
from vector_ops import cross_product

v1 = [1, 0, 0]
v2 = [0, 1, 0]
result = cross_product(v1, v2)
print(f"Cross Product: {result}")
# Output: Cross Product: [0, 0, 1] 
6. Magnitude
from vector_ops import magnitude

v = [1, 2, 3]
result = magnitude(v)
print(f"Magnitude: {result}")
# Output: Magnitude: 3.7416573867739413
